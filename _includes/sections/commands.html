<!-- <p><code>npx h2-watch</code> will tell Hydrogen to continuously watch for changes to your <code>hydrogen.config.json</code> file, as well as your markup, and will automatically compile Hydrogen with your new changes. This is useful for when you need to make a lot of changes to your theme and want to see real output while you're working.</p> -->

{% include heading-3.html name="Watch" %}
<p><code>npx h2-watch</code> will produce a production ready copy of Hydrogen based on your config and then begin to watch the folders that you've specified in your markup and styles options for changes. When these files change, Hydrogen will automatically rebuild itself with the new attributes you've added. <span data-h2-font-weight="b(600)" data-h2-font-color="b(theme-1)">This is probably the command you'll use most</span> and is helpful if you're actively developing on your project. Hydrogen will also watch for changes to your configuration, and perform a more thorough rebuild to account for your new settings.</p>

{% include heading-3.html name="Build" %}
<p><code>npx h2-build</code> is similar to <code>watch</code> but will only run once. This is preferrable if you're preparing to deploy your project for production and will produce a CSS file containing only the styles you've used in your project. You can learn more about this in the "<a data-h2-font-color="b:h(theme-1)" href="#what" title="Learn about how Hydrogen creates its production file.">What is Hydrogen?</a>" section.</p>

{% include heading-3.html name="Compile" %}
<p><code>npx h2-compile</code> will compile Hydrogen's library in its entirety based on your configuration and produces a very large file size. This command is helpful if you don't want to wait for automatic watching to compile for you but will result in longer page load times. This command shouldn't be used in production. </p>
